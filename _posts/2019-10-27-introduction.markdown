### Hello  
I'd like to welcome you with a big speech, a ceremony, a cake, I always liked the idea of being able to send cake to my friends over the internet, but I know it's not possibe. I'd like to welcome you with something you will remember and that would make you think I'm a cool guy, but pretending to be something else just so that people around me can be comfortable can get tiring.  

Truth is that I'm not very cool: I'm anxious, obsessive, whiny, a crybaby and possibly stupid. I'm also very creative, which is good, but I spend more time daydreaming than actually doing stuff. 

I tried writing something for this post but it quickly became an unbearable ramble, so instead I will just tell you what I plan to post on this blog:
 - original stories and other wrting pieces
 - personal reflections and thoughts
 - diary entries maybe?

Sometimes I'm very dramatic, sometimes I overthink everything, and sometimes I'm just unbearable. I like to write characters, romance, and I especially like gore, which I tend to be ashamed of (*there, you said it, it wasn't so hard, it wasn't necessary to ramble on about morality and how much of a disgusting person you are*)  

### So welcome to my stupid blog, hope you enjoy your stay
