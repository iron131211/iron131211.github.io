Nurses come talk to me every now and then, they ask me questions, they give me medication, and today they even drew some blood from me. They are figuring out a medication scheme for my treatment.  

There's a guy that every now and then starts yelling out something about someone who is a son of a bitch, and about the CIA Nazis, and the CIA jews, and the Nazi Jews (???)  

The guy next to me told me he has been here before, and that the first time he was hospitalized it was because he tried to set his own house on fire. The guy in front of me barely talks, and yesterday there was a policeman or security guard who wouldn't leave his side.  

On the other side of the room, there's some patients recovering from surgery and a guy with a broken leg.  

I'm here for the first time because I tried to end my life, and this time there was enough blood for my family to get worried. I don't think that they weren't worried before, but maybe they didn't see it as urgent as they do now  

the first two days were weird, the medication they gave me made me feel like a zombie, but today (third day) I feel a lot better, much more lucid and aware, though I still feel a bit foggy  

I don't want to be here, but I also don't want to be at my house, because my parents wouldn't feel I'm safe there. At least here they know I'm being monitored and taken care of by professionals. It's not an ideal situation, but at least we are adressing a problem that was becoming more and more evident every day.  

I'll try to write something other than this today, I had ideas for a story, but haven't been able to write any of it yet, but I'll see how I feel after today's dose and if I can write something...  

thanks for reading, have a good day
