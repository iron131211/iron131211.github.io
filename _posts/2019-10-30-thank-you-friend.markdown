When you started showing interest, I got worried, I thought it was going to be just like the last time.  

Some time ago, someone asked to see my insides. He was curious and never stopped asking, so one day I caved in. It took a bit of help from him, I was hesitant, but eventually I dug the knife into my abdomen and sliced it open, letting all my organs spill out in front of him. He saw the color of my blood and proclaimed that I was sick and I needed his help. At that time I believed him, everyone said there was something wrong with me, and when this guy saw my insides and said the same, I thought it was true. So I stayed by his side and did as he told, and he would mock me for it and wave it in my face, and if I did something wrong he would tell everyone how sick I was. I eventually got tired of it, so I ran away from him...  

And now you're here, a dim light in the dark...  

You were curious about the poorly stitched up wound in my belly, and when I told you you wouldn't like to see it, you insisted, but didn't pressure me, so when we became close friends, I invited you to my house and we talked about it. And then you asked to see what was inside, and you promised not to get scared if I showed you something ugly, so I shyly pulled the string and the stitches became undone.  

And then my guts spilled out again, this time in front of you, my dear friend, and you saw the color of my blood and you looked me in the eye, and you took your pocket knife and made a small cut on your fingertip... and the color of your blood was similar to mine...  

"It's not exacly royal blue, but it still looks pretty", you said with a smile.  

Then you helped me put my organs back in their place and you carefully stitched the gap together. We hugged and we laughed, and you didn't ask anymore from me... You just liked me the way I was...  

I'm sorry, I got emotional again... All I wanted to say is thank you. Even if sometimes we disagree on some things, or we just plain don't think the same, thank you for accepting me the way I am.
